### My Little Web Dev Handbook

My very first page.
After spending a month studying the fundamentals about this markdown language called HTML, about styling and coding... I decided to start taking action and put what I've been trying to learn into use. To create a simple project in which those fundamentals get to work all together.

Honestly, it might not seem like much, but I'm really proud of the outcome. It marks the beginning of something that will hopefully be my future work for years to come. One that I have passion for. Coding and debuggin is fun, and there's just so many things to learn. So many technologies. Designing and giving life into a page while starting from a blank canvas is simply just awesome. It's a form of art, I dare say.

Anyway, the website so far is split into three sections.  
- In the first page, you'll get to read a few things about me and the project.  
- In the second page, you'll find resources and content that helped me learn what I had to know to make a start. Basically usefull information from articles and videos that can help one have some understanding to build their very first page as well. Figured it would be nice to come back to these, sometime in the future as well.  
- In the third page, it's a similar case, but it's all about tools, extensions and websites that can help do things faster and better. It's basically stuff that I use or have used.

I've learned so many things since the day I finished this. Things like new technologies, techniques, amazing tools, as well as more advanced ways to do things and better practices. Been like 5-6 months since.  
Still, it's probably a decent enough place to start reading what I did, and end up building something simple and nice.
